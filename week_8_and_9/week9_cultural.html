			<h1>Feedback</h1>

			<p>
				Feedback was most useful to me when it gave me things that were actionable. What I mean by that is, not only was the feedback encouraging and positive, but it also had respectable things for me to work on. Often times everyone, including me sometimes, is too nice and doesn't leave anything to work on. That leads to when feedback is not as useful. According to DBC, feedback should be kind, actionable, and specific. Not only does the feedback need to have some things to work on, but it needs to point to specific skills and concepts that needs some work. <br></br>

				Feedback encouraged change when pairing because it got me thinking in the manner of my partner's mind. If they have a problem with some manner of how I was pairing, I want to do whatever I can to improve in order to maximize learning and also, build relationships. Building relationships is one of my top goals throughout this experience. I really want to ensure that I am doing whatever I can to make myself easy to work with and hopefully, maintain friendships in the future. <br></br>

				Feedback doesn't always have to be negative. You should let the person know when they did something good because it promotes a healthy working environment. You can give meaningful positive feedback by incorporating feedback that is kind, specific, and still actionable. As long as you are respectful and kind, the feedback that you give can helpful and nice.
