			<h1>What is Rails?</h1>

			<p>
				Rails is an open source application framework. Rails works wth the Ruby programming language to create pages and applications, query databases, and render templates out of the box. It was created by David Hansson and first released in 2004.<br></br>

				Ruby on Rails utilizes the model-view-controller, which organizes application programming. Basically, a controller is a component of Rails that responds to external requests from the web server to the application by determining which file to render.<br></br>

				Rails is a software library that extends the Ruby programming language. Basically, it is a framework for building websites. Rails combines Ruby with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web applications. Ruby was chosen for the main programming language because it is concise and concrete. It doesn't require a lot of punctuation in order to get the code moving. Ruby also utilizes RubyGems. Well back to Rails..Rails is popular and widely used because its conventions are pervasive and astute.
