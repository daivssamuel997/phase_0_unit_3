Paired with Chris and Hunter on this challenge. 

What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?

Everything worked very well. We went through this one step at a time and didn't face too many problems. 

What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

When we had questions, we referred to the helpful information from the week 7 challenge. This information seemed to help out quite a bit. 

What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?

Not really having trouble with too many concepts. Just trying to learn as much of it as I can. It is all new for the most part when it comes to sql and I def need to spend some more time on it. 

Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

I just got more practice using the terminal and sqlite. It was helpful.

Pretty confident. Need to spend some more time on it though.
