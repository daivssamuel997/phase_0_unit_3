			<h1>Chefs in the Kitchen</h1>

			<p>
				 This was a very interesting topic to write a blog post about because I have actually thought about what he said several times before. In the video, he talked about how some people come in and think that other people are probably more experienced programmers. I know that I have done my best at teaching myself this stuff, but I don't think that I am a master at it. I know that I am going to make mistakes and really have a lot to learn. That is exciting and a little terrifying actually. I really want to succeed and get the most out of this wonderful experience as possible. <br></br>

				 Another topic in the video was building relationships with people that you will know for the rest of your lives. I really am excited to meet some great people and I hope to really become great friends with everyone. The people that we are going to be learning with could be potential bosses or coworkers in the future and that is pretty cool to think about. I think that DBC is great from what I have seen so far and I truly believe that this is going to be a life changing experience. I know that everyone is going to work hard and that the teachers are going to do their best to teach us. Like it was stated in the video, everyone is part of the same kitchen and though we might not be great programmers when we come in, we sure can become better programmers with hard work. I really see myself fitting in great with the culture of DBC. I am ready to give it my all in learning and being active with the material. I am excited to be able to do nothing besides focusing on DBC for the weeks following my arivial there. No other work or distractions. It will be great.
