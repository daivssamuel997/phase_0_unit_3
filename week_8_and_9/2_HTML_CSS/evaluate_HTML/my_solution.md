## Evaluate a Website!

1) How does this website follow HTML Best Practices? Are there any places where 
it does not?  Provide examples of the "bad" code.

There were many other good things, but here are some negatives that I noticed. They didn't declare the external css files at the top. This was confusing to find and I honestly couldn't even find all of them. This leads to another problem, I noticed that even though they have some css in a sheet, they still sneak in some styling in the html code. According to the 30 HTML Best practices, neither of these are good. That being said, it looks to be organized well for the most part. 
 
2) What do you think of the HTML? Did the writers use IDs and Classes properly? 

I think that it is a little confusing. This is the language that I am least comfortable with. From what it looks like though they do a nice job assigning ids to each of the articles on the site. Each article is in a different div id block and I think that this makes it easily to read and understand. 

Did you like the way they used HTML tags?  Please use examples with your arguments.

I don't think so. I really had difficulty finding any HTML tags. I think that this is bad practices because it doesn't really make anything pop out at the viewer directly.
 
3) How did the authors handle formatting? Did they include it in the HTML or 
separate it into a CSS file? Or did they do both?  Again, include examples.

They have a separate CSS file, but they did do some styling in the HTML file. On line 1652 for example, it aligns the text and sets the width to 110px. There are several times that they do this, but I am not completely sure how we should go about doing this. It says in the practices document that it is a good idea to keep them separate, but they do it and that confuses me. 
 
4) Did the authors include anything you didn't immediately understand? 
If so, what?

Yes, on line 1638 they use a script id. Is this simply to include a text file? That is what it looks like and being that this is a news site, that is what I would guess. I would really like to learn more about combining HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails, and Javascript. My cousin showed me some stuff that he is doing in his company. This was cool to me and it excites me to learn more. 

 
5) How did the authors organize the CSS file? Was it DRY?

The CSS file is very short and DRY. It is pretty short because they incorporated some extra styling in the HTML file, which we are not recommended to do. I would have liked for them to try and keep the styling a little more together. The HTML was organized nicely into id blocks, but was a little sloppy. 
 
6) Did the authors incorporate any responsive design into the site?

Yes they did. This site really goes above and beyond with posting videos, that must involve user interaction to start them. You can also commit on each of the articles. The top of the website has shifting pictures, thus a form of media queries.
 
7) What are your overall thoughts on the HTML/CSS from this website based on 
what you've read?

My thoughts are that it is all super cool how everything is written of just some code, that anyone can learn to do. I know that we all have a long way to go, but with a lot of hard work and practice, we can all achieve our dreams. I do know though that this is my weakest part of the program and I hope we really spend some good time working on some of the more technical things, for I am excited to learn and get better.
